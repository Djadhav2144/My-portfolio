            <h2>Indroduction To Nature</h2>
            <p>Nature is an inherent character or constitution,[1] particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole.
               In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world.<br>
              luding life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.[

                <h2>About Nature</h2>
                <p>During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.[3][4] With the Industrial Revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention:  
                considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence

                    <h2>Importance of nature</h2>
                     <p>Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife.
                     Nature can refer to the general realm of living beings, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objectsâ€”the way that
                     particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth
